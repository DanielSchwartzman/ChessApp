# About ChessApp:
ChessApp is a simple Android chess game with options for multiplayer on same device or multiplayer on two separate devices.

## Two players on same device:
Allows you to play a game of chess vs another player on a the same device.

## Internet play:
Allows you to play a game of chess with another player on another device.
To start, press "Internet play" on the start menu, then select whether "Host game" or "Join game".

* If you clicked "Host game", the game enters a standby mode and waits untill another player joins the session, for the second player to connect to your game,
  simply tell the other player to join your game with the Game number that appears right above the playing board.
  
* If you want to join another players game, ask them their room number(which should appear right above their chess board) and insert the number in the "Game number" field, and click "Join game".

NOTE- Currently, any straying from the game board while playing in "Internet play" will automatically close the session.
