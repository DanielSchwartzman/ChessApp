ChessApp is a Chess game application for android devices featuring both multiplayer on one device and multiplayer on two separate devices. Made as a final project for Android Development course in Afeka College of Engineering in Tel-Aviv.

# Game modes:
ChessApp features two main game modes, "Two players" mode, and "Internet Play" game mode.

## Two players on same device:
Allows you to play a game of chess vs another player on a the same device.

## Internet play:
Allows you to play a game of chess with another player on another device.
To start, press "Internet play" on the start menu and login to your account(or make a new one), then select whether to "Host game" or "Join game".

* If you clicked "Host game", the game enters a standby mode and waits untill another player joins the session, for the second player to connect to your game,
  simply tell the other player to join your game with the Game number that appears right above the playing board.
  
* If you want to join another players game, ask them their room number(which should appear right above their chess board) and insert the number in the "Game number" field, and click "Join game".
